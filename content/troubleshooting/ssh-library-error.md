This page referrs to the error that looks something like this:

```
An error occurred in the underlying SSH library that Vagrant uses.
The error message is shown below. In many cases, errors from this
library are caused by ssh-agent issues. Try disabling your SSH
agent or removing some keys and try again.

If the problem persists, please report a bug to the net-ssh project.

timeout during server version negotiating
```

This error usually appears when the host system is under high load. To resolve this issue, try the following:

1. Close resource-intensive applications
2. Run `vagrant halt`, followed by `vagrant up`
3. If the issue is not resolved, try steps 1 and 2 again (at least step 2) again
4. If the issue still persists, a system reboot usually resolves this issue
