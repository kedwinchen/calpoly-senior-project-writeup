## Vagrantfile

The `Vagrantfile` is located [here](https://vagrant-kedwin.chen.network/2021-spring/csc/422/Vagrantfile)

To use, [follow the instructions]({{< relref "/instructions/students" >}})

## Special Notices/Instructions

- All VMs except the `router` VM should not be directly connected to the network.
  Even though the NAT adapter is connected, no traffic should leave through that adapter by default.
  Traffic is routed instead to the `router` VM.
- The `router` VM does not route traffic by default. This is intended (it is the first lab assignment, or so I am told).
- There are multiple VMs in this `Vagrantfile`, so you will need to specify the VM name when using `vagrant ssh`
  (i.e., instead of `vagrant ssh`, use `vagrant ssh client` or `vagrant ssh testing` to log into the `client` or `testing` VM, respectively)

  | Virtual Machine  | Private Network IP Address |
  | :--------------: | :------------------------: |
  |     `router`     |      `192.168.22.101`      |
  |    `testing`     |      `192.168.22.102`      |
  | `metasploitable` |      `192.168.22.103`      |
  |     `client`     |      `192.168.22.104`      |

- The network configuration script to enable the VMs to talk to the `router` VM is
  [located here](https://vagrant-kedwin.chen.network/2021-spring/csc/422/configure_networking.sh).

  **_It is also run each time at boot._** If you encounter an error like the following, it is probably because the script has been updated.
  To resolve the error, simply re-download the `Vagrantfile` and re-run `vagrant up`
