## Vagrantfile

The `Vagrantfile` is located [here](https://vagrant-kedwin.chen.network/2021-spring/csc/422/Vagrantfile)

To use, [follow the instructions]({{< relref "/instructions/students" >}})

## Special Notices/Instructions

- All VMs except the `router` VM should not be directly connected to the network.
  Even though the NAT adapter is connected, no traffic should leave through that adapter by default.
  Traffic is routed instead to the `router` VM.
- The `router` and `testing` VMs do not route traffic by default. This is intended (it is the first lab assignment, or so I am told).
- There are multiple VMs in this `Vagrantfile`, so you will need to specify the VM name when using `vagrant ssh`
  (i.e., instead of `vagrant ssh`, use `vagrant ssh client` or `vagrant ssh testing` to log into the `client` or `testing` VM, respectively)

  | Virtual Machine  |      Private Network IP Address       |
  | :--------------: | :-----------------------------------: |
  |     `router`     |           `192.168.22.101`            |
  |    `testing`     | `192.168.22.102` and `192.168.22.103` |
  | `metasploitable` |           `192.168.23.103`            |
  |     `client`     |           `192.168.23.104`            |

- The network configuration script to enable the VMs to talk to the `router` VM is
  [located here](https://vagrant-kedwin.chen.network/2021-spring/csc/422/configure_networking.sh).

  **_It is also run each time at boot._** If you encounter an error like the following, it is probably because the script has been updated.
  To resolve the error, simply re-download the `Vagrantfile` and re-run `vagrant up`

  ```
  The calculated checksum of the requested file does not match the expected
  checksum!

  File source:         https:// <url snipped> /configure_networking.sh
  Checksum type:       sha512
  Expected checksum:   <checksum snipped>
  Calculated checksum: <checksum snipped>

  ```

- The following software is installed on each VM:

  {{< tabs "csc-422-installed-software" >}}
  {{< tab "router" >}}

  - `iptables`
  - `snort`

  {{< /tab >}}
  {{< tab "testing" >}}

  - `mitmproxy`
  - `nmap`
  - Metasploit Framework (Community Edition)

  {{< /tab >}}
  {{< tab "metasploitable" >}}
  [See the official repository](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploitable3)
  {{< /tab >}}
  {{< tab "client" >}}
  Nothing special. This is just a basic lubuntu 20.04 LTS installation

## System Requirements

- Minimum specifications:

  - RAM (memory): 5 GiB
  - CPU (processor): amd64/x86_64 quad-core (or dual-core with Hyper-Threading)
  - Disk space (hard drive/solid state): 32 GiB free space

- Recommended specifications:

  - RAM (memory): 16 GiB
  - CPU (processor): amd64/x86_64 quad-core with Hyper-Threading
  - Disk space (hard drive/solid state): 64 GiB free space

## Network Topology

This is the network topology as provisioned by the `Vagrantfile` and `configure_networking.sh`
