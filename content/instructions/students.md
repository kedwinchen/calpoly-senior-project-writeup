1. Follow the [common procedures](../common)
2. Obtain the `Vagrantfile` for the course

        Note: Vagrant requires that the Vagrantfile does not have an extension.
        Some browsers may try to save the Vagrantfile as "Vagrantfile.txt" -- this will not work.
        You may need to manually remove the extension
        (saving as type "All Files" instead of "Text Document" often resolves this issue.)

3. Navigate to the folder you saved `Vagrantfile` to
4. Run `vagrant up`
